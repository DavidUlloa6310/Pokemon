A spin on the classic Rock, Paper, Scissor game with a Pokemon theme!

<h2>Select Your Trainer!</h2>

In the first page of the game, you are allowed to select what trainer you would like to play as.
Further, the game also takes you through a tutorial of the basic game mechanics.
You start by selecting the type you would like to play in your turn - Grass, Fire, or Water. Fire beats Grass, Grass beats Water, Water beats Fire.
Just as in Rock Paper Scissor, beating your opponent's type wins you the round and has the enemy take damage. By beating your consecutively without dying, you charge up your damage boost. Your damage boost gives you a 2x damage increase on your next attack.

<h2>Campaign: Fight Through Pokemon Heart Gold!</h2>

The game includes a campaign section, where you can fight all 8 Gym Leaders and the Elite Four Members to collect all 8 Gym Badges. Each gym leader has a different set of Pokemon, though they are all either Fire, Grass or Water in order to oblige by the Rock, Paper, Scissor format. 

<h2>Endless Mode: For those who want a challenge!</h2>

The endless mode includes a series of battles against trainers who as you beat, level up and get harder to defeat.

<h2> Other Features! </h2>

The shop allows you to buy a miriad of items which can help you in your battles, whether it be in the campaign or endless mode. These items can be game changing: increased money for each win, not allowing the enemy to use certain Pokemon types, boosting damage of certain pokemon types, and healing yourself from damage.

As you level up, your Pokemon can also evolve into stronger Pokemon. As can be seen in the image above, our charmander evolved into a charmeleon once we reached level 16. This can happen once again when we reach level 36, where our Charmeleon would evolve into a Charizard.
